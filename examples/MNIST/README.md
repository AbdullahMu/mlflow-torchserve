# Deploying MNIST handwritten digit recognition using torchserve

This folder contains there different examples as shown below

1. `example1` - Demonstrates training of MNIST handwritten digit recognition and deployment of the model using torchserve plugin with `mlflow cli` commands.
2. `example2` - Demonstrates training of MNIST handwritten digit recognition and deployment of the model using mlflow-torchserve **python plugin**
3. `example3` - This example trains MNIST model and uses  `mlflow.pytorch` library to save the model with additional artifacts.
                Mnist model is deployed using torchserve plugin along with predictions.
